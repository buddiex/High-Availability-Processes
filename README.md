Implementation of client, proxy, and  server with high availability:  
`Fault-Tolerant Tuple Space Service`  
The specifications are in `specs.doc`  
this spec where written by my [Dr. Phil Pfeiffer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philpfeiffer/).  
  
  
## Details  
  
CSCI 5150:  Phil Pfeiffer  
Software-based final exam â€“ fault-tolerant tuple space service  
Terms:  As individuals or in pairs  
Due date: Monday, 10 December, close of business, with interviews to follow  
  
## Background:  
One reason for implementing a distributed system is to assure a service's _fault-tolerance_: i.e., its ability to operate after component failures.  One classic architecture for ensuring fault tolerance, the **_active-passive_** architecture, uses a second, **_hot-swap_** server to back up a primary server (Figure 1). This configuration operates as follows:  
- The primary (i.e., active) server, in normal operation,  
   - Receives and responds to all requests from client computers  
   - Relays all requests for updating the primary's internal state to the backup, which maintains a duplicate of the primary's internal state.  
- The primary and backup servers, in normal operation, monitor each other's status, using "heartbeat" messages.  
- If one of the servers detects that the other has failed:  
   - If the primary detects a failure of the backup  
      - It notifies an operator that a failure has occurred and keeps operating.  
      - The operator should then  
         - restore the backup  
         - initiate a procedure for resynchronizing its state with the primary server  
   - If the backup server detects a failure of the primary  
      - It triggers the computer-controlled switch,  rerouting of client requests from the failed primary to itself.  
      - It notifies an operator that a failure has occurred and keeps operating.  
      - The operator should then  
         - restore the primary, which becomes the backup  
         - initiate a procedure for resynchronizing its state with the primary  
  
This assignment asks you to implement a comparable configuration, using a proxy server in place of the "deadman" switch (Figure 2).  
  
## Requirements: 
The requirements for this assignment are divisible into requirements for   
- The service    
- Primary and backup servers;   
- Proxy server  
- Client application
### Functional Requirements for Service
-   The service shall provide a database service in the form of a tuple space:  i.e.,
	-   a collection of (key, value) pairs, where
		-   keys and values are n-tuples of alphanumeric strings
		-   the space has at most one value per key
	-   together with four operators:
		-   **GET** - given a (**keyexp**, **valexp**) pair,
			-   if the (**keyexp**, **valexp**) pattern is malformed, return an empty list.
			    _Note_: assume [Python regular expression syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) for **keyexp** and **valexp**.
			-   else, return all (**key**, **value**) pairs such that
				-   **key** matches **keyexp**
				-   **value** matches **valexp**
		-   **PUT** -given a purported list of (**key**, **value**) pairs,
			-   if the list is malformed, return an indication to this effect
			-   else
				-   for every pair such that
					-   **key** and **value** are well-formed and
					-   **key** is not yet present in the tuple space
				
				add (**key**, **value**) to the tuple space

				-   return all (**key**, **value**) pairs that could not be added to the tuple space
		-   **POST** -given a purported list of (**key**, **value**) pairs,
			-   if the list itself is malformed, return an indication to this effect
			-   else
				-   for every pair such that
					-   **key** and **value** are well-formed and
					-   **key** is not present in the tuple space
				update the value associated with **key** to **value**
			-   return  all (**key**, **value**) pairs that were not used to update the tuple space
		-   **DELETE** - given a (**keyexp**, **valexp**) pair,
			-   if the (**keyexp**, **valexp**) pattern is malformed, return an empty list.

				_Note_: assume [Python regular expression syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) for **keyexp** and **valexp**.

			-   otherwise
			-   remove all (**key**, **value**) pairs from the tuple space such that
				-   **key** matches **keyexp**
				-   **value** matches **valexp**
			-   return a list of all (**key**, **value**) pairs that were removed from the tuple space
-   The service shall respond to other operators with an indication that the operator is not implemented.
